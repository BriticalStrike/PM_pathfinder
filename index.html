        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>As libraries are oftentimes becoming more and more unpredictable in their programming, tending to bend to the needs of its community, it is getting more important for librarians to think on their toes. Librarians can be juggling many different projects at a time while working with a myriad of people including staff, stakeholders, community leaders, and patrons. Libraries are also oftentimes iterating over their programs and trying to come up with the best possible solutions to community problems. This makes libraries great candidates for utilizing agile project management, and even in some cases, Scrum. The ability to adapt agile principles and strategies to any given project and work with a team-based approach is essential. This pathfinder will help library staff research agile project management and Scrum to apply essential principles and theory to their own libraries. In addition to essential tools and resources for agile and Scrum, this pathfinder includes articles that frame libraries in a startup-type context and relate the diverse and innovative projects to software development, the main contributor to agile project management literature.</p>

        <p>The scope of this pathfinder is a close look at agile project management and Scrum, with additional research to frame these resources within the context of library and information science (LIS). This pathfinder does not take a look at library management theory in general and has been created for an audience that is alrady knowledgeable about LIS.</p>

                    <p>Brian Mathews is the Associate Dean for Learning and Outreach at Virginia Tech. This white paper takes the culture of startups and applies this to library programming. It is meant to shake up the idea of a library and apply some of the more innovative practices startups use. As agile project management and, more pointedly, Scrum is oftentimes used in software startups, this type of thinking ties contemporary library thought into the more innovative and active project management styles.</p></li>

It has the ability to search for open-access or .pdfs of articles related to the topic. It pulls from all parts of the Internet, not just one database, so it will sometimes find resources that are restricted. Oftentimes, however, it will find articles that may be restricted on one site, but have a .pdf available on another site.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Subscription-Based Databases</h4>
                <p>The following are subscription-based databases. While some of them grant access to open-access articles or journals, many of the articles in them are restricted. If something relevant is found, it can be searched for on one of the above databases or found through a local or school library's subscription. These databases are ranked in order of their usefulness without a subscription.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/" target="_blank">Emerald Insight</a>: An academic database with access to journals, articles, and books. Search queries can be filtered to only include articles that are open-access or available with the school or local library subscription.</p></li>

        <h3 id="subjects">Keywords, Phrases, and Subject Headings</h3>
        <p>When searching for library-related articles, it is important to combine subject keywords such as “agile AND project management AND libraries” or “scrum AND libraries”. While searching through these articles, I found it interesting that many of them also contained keywords like the list found below under "Tags found on relevant articles". Depending on what type of article you need for a specific type of paper, whether it be about managing collections, teams, or digital services, it would be important to include those keywords in a search, as well, which might look something like “agile AND libraries AND digital services”.</p>

        <p>Start the groundwork for understanding agile project management and Scrum via the websites provided. Refer to these websites for glossary terms or trends in the world of agile project management. Once you have a good idea of what you are looking for, utilize your local library and school library’s subscription databases and search for the keywords provided. In this case, EBSCOHost, TandFOnline, and EmeraldInsight were the most helpful, but all were accessed through San Jose State University’s King Library Databases. If some articles seem relevant, but have restricted access, try finding them on Google Scholar or search the doi with “pdf” in the search bar. Sometimes, articles will be restricted on one site, but there will be another website that has a .pdf version of the article.</p>

        <p>Remember, research is iterative and oftentimes you may find yourself revisiting articles, websites, and community forums. Don’t be afraid to search community questions and answers to find what you are looking for or to even find what you you should be looking for. This pathfinder serves as a base of understanding and a starting point to researching agile project management, Scrum, and how it can be applied to libraries.</p>

        <h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
        <p>I believe this list is extensive enough to gather all research on the topic at hand. The resources provided give a great overview of agile project management and Scrum, while the LIS-related articles and journals provide a foundation for beginning to think of the library in terms of fast-paced futuristic project hubs that will need to adopt agile project management strategies to keep up with growing community needs.</p>
